Vascular plants Definition and Examples Biology Online Dictionary From biologyonline.com
They are those plants which possess conducting or vascular tissues, xylem and phloem. Nonvascular plants are the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The gametophyte is haploid, bearing only one set of chromosomes per cell. Vascular plants can grow large and tall.

<p>The meaning of vascular plant is a plant having a specialized conducting system that includes xylem and phloem : They contain xylem for water and mineral transport from roots to different parts of the plant and phloem for the transport of food from leaves to other parts of the plant. After gaining vascular systems, plants were able to circulate water and nutrients more efficiently, thus being able to grow larger, have more leaves, develop branched systems of roots and shoots.

<p>They are the most visible green plants around us, so much so that the term plants generally means vascular plants. These type of plants can grow much longer. The gametophyte is haploid, bearing only one set of chromosomes per cell. A nonvascular plant is any species of plant which does not have specialized vascular tissues.

<p>Plants with vascular tissue (i.e., all plants other than mosses and their relatives). Xylem and phloem are the most common Xylem transports water and minerals while phloem conducts organic food. Vascular plants are the green plants, which have specialized tissues for transporting food, water and minerals to all parts of the plant.

<p>The gametophyte is haploid, bearing only one set of chromosomes per cell. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant. These tissues (xylem and phloem) constitute the vascular system. They contain xylem for water and mineral transport from roots to different parts of the plant and phloem for the transport of food from leaves to other parts of the plant. Vascular tissue.</p>

<p>These systems have evolved as vascular plants are typically large and therefore need special systems to connect the. In vascular plants, the principal generation or phase is the sporophyte, which produces spores and is. Plant vascular systems consist of xylem, concerned mainly with the conduction of water and dissolved minerals, and phloem, which functions mainly in the conduction of foods, such as sugar.

Vascular plants comprise more than 275,000 living species. Vascular plants include all modern species except the mosses and their relatives.</p>
