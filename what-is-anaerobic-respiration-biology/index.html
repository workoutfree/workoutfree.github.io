A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration where respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. 18.5 Anaerobic Respiration a level biology student.</p>
