<p>In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of âdefinite antiphospholipid syndromeâ is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. Aps is an autoimmune disorder that produces anticardiolipin antibodies. See the sample requirements page for an explanation of all the sample requirements. Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the bodyâs own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets.
