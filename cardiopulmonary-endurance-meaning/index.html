This, as a result, makes your body deliver oxygenated blood to your muscles more efficiently. Cardiovascular endurance occurs after the phosphogen and glycogen lactic acid system. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) could lead to poor cardiopulmonary endurance, which affects quality of life and increases the risk of rehospitalization or mortality. Besides, it can also improve your lung capacity to increase your vo2 max over time.
