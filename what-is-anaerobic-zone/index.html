<p>The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. There is a narrower and a broader range of heart rates given for the aerobic exercise zone. Maintaining anoxic/anaerobic zones requires mixing of the basin contents and influent streams while avoiding the introduction of free oxygen. Anoxic zones in wastewater are useful for nitrogen removal. Anaerobic exercise, cardio and heart rate Phoenix Rising ME/CFS Forums.</p>
