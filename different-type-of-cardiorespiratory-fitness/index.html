<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness activities are those that improve the body's ability to process and use oxygen. Submaximal exercise tests are used to measure your cardiorespiratory endurance. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy production needed during physical activity. This chapter defines cardiorespiratory fitness, examines the benefits of a healthy cr system, and explores how to effectively assess and improve the cr system.</p>
