Dehydration In Athletes Can It Affect Athletic Performance? LCR Health From lcrhealth.com
A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. The effect of high ambient temperatures on exercise performance is most evident in prolonged submaximal exercise. For example, exercise raises the body temperature rhythm and allows your body temperatures to ‘peak’ at a higher level. That is because energy produced in contracting muscles is used for muscle contraction by about 20 %, and the other 80 % is converted to heat energy and therefore increases muscle temperature.
