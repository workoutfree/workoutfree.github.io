First published on wednesday 17 february 2016. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. For the last two intervals of the workout, run the first 800m of each interval at 5k pace, but sizzle through the last 400m of the interval at 2 seconds per 400 faster than 5k pace. Anaerobic exercises are high intensity workouts that are performed for a short time.
