<p>You can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. Exercise affects all people differently, specifically a person’s heart rate and blood pressure. At any given exercise intensity level, your bigger, stronger heart can supply the required oxygen at a slower heart rate. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Pin on Athletic Training.</p>
