Exercise, particularly weight lifting, can also help to grow muscle mass. Weight training is most effective in overall strength because it is muscle strength that overcomes the stress with an initial burst of activity. This temporary weight gain is a result of many beneficial processes that will improve your health and body composition in the long run.
