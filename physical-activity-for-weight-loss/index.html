<p>Physical activity (pa) and exercise training (et) are associated with reduced cv risk, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and facilitated weight loss through creating a negative energy balance. It also lowers the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and weight gain. Physical activity increases people’s total energy expenditure, which can help them stay in energy balance or even lose weight, as long as they don’t eat more to compensate for the extra calories they burn. When losing weight, more physical activity increases the number of calories your body uses for energy or “burns off.” the burning of calories through physical activity, combined with reducing the number of calories you eat, creates a “calorie deficit” that results in weight loss.</p>
