The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody. Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in. A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding.

The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. This phospholipid plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetic processes including the production of atp. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an.
