Human respiration From slideshare.net
Processes that take place in the cells and tissues during which energy is released and carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed by the blood to be transported to the lungs. In adults, it is a respiratory rate of less than 12 breaths per minute. Mitochondria is the site of respiration and the energy released is stored in the form of atp (adenosine triphosphate). Respiration is an oxidation reaction in which carbohydrate is oxidized to produce energy.
