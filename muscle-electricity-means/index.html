Muscular power is the ability to generate as much force as possible, as quickly as possible. Because stores of creatine phosphate are also limited, this energy system can only sustain maximal muscle output for about 10 seconds. On the speedfit website, it explains that by. Activating more muscle fibers means a greater portion of the muscle will undergo the microtears that occur during strength training and cause the muscle to heal bigger, better, and stronger than before.

Skeletal muscles appear to be striated (or striped) because each myofibril is composed of a series of elements called sarcomeres, which are where the action is.the sarcomeres are placed end to end along the myofibril and contain two types of filaments: Once this happens, myosin can used the energy gained from atp to crawl along the actin filament. As electric current is conducted through a material, any opposition to the current (resistance) results in a dissipation of energy, usually in the form of heat.
