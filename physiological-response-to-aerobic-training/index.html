Physiological adaptations in response to aerobic training From slideshare.net
Body systems work together, to make sure that you have enough energy to perform. An exercise such as running can be both aerobic and anaerobic, depending on the pace you keep up. However, individual response to an aerobic training program can vary. This results in a marked increase and redistribution of the cardiac output.

This is present in aerobic training when intensity, duration, frequency, or any combination of the three are exceeded by an individual in their. The bones become stressed during exercise when the tendons and muscles pull. Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen.

<p>The expectancy of an effect of fitness on the physiological stress response is based on the assumption that this response resembles the response to exercise. This increase in demand forces the body to instantaneously make adjustments to the working systems and eventually adapt. These responses are directly proportional to the intensity, duration, frequency. Oxygen is provided by blood flow, and, in essence, changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. Physiological Responses to Exercise.

Oxygen is provided by blood flow, and, in essence, changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. Typically, aerobic training causes your heart to beat at a range of 70 to 80 percent of its maximum. Physiological adaptations in response to aerobic training.</p>

<p>The comparability of the results is hampered by the differences in operationalization of aerobic fitness and by the confusion of the terms aerobic fitness, training and habitual physical exercise. An exercise such as running can be both aerobic and anaerobic, depending on the pace you keep up. Find acute physiological responses to aerobic exercise. When you begin to exercise your body must immediately adjust to the change in activity level. Integrative Biology of Exercise Cell.</p>

<p>An acute physiological response refers to an immediate response of one or more of the bodies systems to exercise, such as the heart rate increasing as a gym member sits on the bike and starts their warm up. These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance.
