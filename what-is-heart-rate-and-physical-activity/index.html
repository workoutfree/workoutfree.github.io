How Heart Rate Zones Work Visual.ly From visual.ly
Regular aerobic exercise strengthens your heart over time. We have demonstrated that the activation of metabolically sensitive receptors in skeletal muscles (muscle metaboreflex) increases cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. Your target heart rate zone (training zone) is the range between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Many americans are not active enough.

Heart rate (hr) is the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) and an increase during physical activity is normal. Therefore, their heart needs less beats to pump the oxygenated blood to the muscles in need of it. We have demonstrated that the activation of metabolically sensitive receptors in skeletal muscles (muscle metaboreflex) increases cardiac sympathetic nerve activity.
