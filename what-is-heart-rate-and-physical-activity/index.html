How Heart Rate Zones Work Visual.ly From visual.ly
Regular aerobic exercise strengthens your heart over time. We have demonstrated that the activation of metabolically sensitive receptors in skeletal muscles (muscle metaboreflex) increases cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. Your target heart rate zone (training zone) is the range between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Many americans are not active enough.
