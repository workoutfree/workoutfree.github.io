<p>In this zone your breathing quickens, but youâre not out of breath, and you can still have a conversation with a person running next to you. When you train within the aerobic zone, your heart beats between 120 and 137 beats per minute. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. The effects of cold and exercise on the cardiovascular system Heart.</p>
