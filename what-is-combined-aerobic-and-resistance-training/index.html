Purpose this study examined the effects of performing combined resistance and aerobic training, versus aerobic training alone, in patients with coronary artery disease. Combined aerobic and resistance training and vascular function: We examined the effects of sprint interval (sit) and combined aerobic &#43; resistance (comb) training on hba1c and (primary outcome) in participants with t2d. Accordingly, it is reasonable to suppose that the resistance training component of combined training may limit, to a certain degree, the.
