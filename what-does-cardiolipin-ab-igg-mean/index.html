Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: Cardiolipin antibodies (ca) are seen in a subgroup of patients with autoimmune disorders, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), who are at risk for vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral infarct and/or recurrent. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood.
