This maximizes the amount of oxygen in your lungs. Over time, this also helps chest caving become larger. Your brain senses the low oxygen levels and stimulates your body to respond very quickly by making you breathe more rapidly and more deeply. Creatine supplementation has been shown to be effective in improving performance in simple anaerobic events of short duration.
