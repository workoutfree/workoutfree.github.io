<p>The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. Depending on your age and level of physical fitness, a normal resting pulse ranges from 60 to 80 beats per minute. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute.</p>

The following graph shows the data on the relationship between respiration rate and heart rate for my 3/26 run (tempo run): Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. From the graph, we can see that the average heart rate of exercise at 20 minutes 30 seconds is around 171 bpm (pace 3’53’/k), and the average respiration rate is 36brpm, so the heart rate ÷ respiration rate = 4.75.
