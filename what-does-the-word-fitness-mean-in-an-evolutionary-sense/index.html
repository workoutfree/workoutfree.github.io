Two distinct colour forms of the pupae are found, namely brown and green, with very few intermediates. In evolutionary terms, “fitness” refers to an organism’s ability to reproduce successfully or to have the potential to reproduce successfully — in other words, its ability to contribute to the gene pool of its species.
