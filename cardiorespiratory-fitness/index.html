Cardiorespiratory fitness measuring the aerobic capacity of the population From technogym.com
Blah, blah, technical jargon, blah, blah. A term used to describe food energy. The aim of the study was to describe the levels and to create reference values of cardiorespiratory fitness, expressed as maximal oxygen consumption (vo(2max) ), maximal metabolic equivalents (mets) and maximal workload in aging men and women. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity.
