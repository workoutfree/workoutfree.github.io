Let&#39;s talk about… aerobic and anaerobic exercise MsDyio From msdyio.com
The main difference between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise is that aerobic exercises depend on the inhalation of oxygen by the body as a source of energy. Exercise that does not improve or is not intended to improve the efficiency of the body&#39;s cardiovascular system. Here are three examples of anaerobic exercise: However, the difference between the two is that:

<p>Anaerobic power and anaerobic capacity can be measured separately and by different tests and methods, however a correlation between the two is plausible. Aerobic capacity is tested often while training road cyclists, swimmers, and rowers in order to assess cardiovascular fitness and to evaluate the training scheme.
