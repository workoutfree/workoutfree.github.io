Electrophysiology studies test the electrical activity of your heart to find where an arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) is coming from. Included are the identification of a patient population amenable to ep testing, a routine setup for ep testing, and the common protocols performed during ep testing. They will feed very fine wires (catheters) through the tube and guide them to your heart. The heart&#39;s electrical system produces signals (impulses) that control the timing of the heartbeats.
