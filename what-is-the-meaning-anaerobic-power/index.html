Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences From byjus.com
[adjective] living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen. With the increase of training equipment for endurance exercises in the last 10 years or so the role of aerobic and anaerobic threshold has moved from common language used by elite and sub elite endurance athletes to terminology used by many of those who compete at a much lower level or indeed participate in endurance sport purely as recreational pursuit to keep. Meaning they have greater protection against injury. Abbreviation is mostly used in categories:
