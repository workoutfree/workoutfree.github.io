Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. The purpose of this review is therefore to identify and evaluate original research examining the influence of strength training on road cycling endurance performance in highly trained cyclists.</p>
