Motor fitness From slideshare.net
We welcome innovative, simple, and feasible interventions (active commuting to/from school, active physical education lessons, active school recess, after school programs, health promotion, or an integrated program incorporating all interventions) to improve motor competence, physical activity, and physical fitness in school children. Walking, running, stretching, bending, catching, and throwing are all motor skills. Physical education provides a scope for an understanding of the biological aspects of the human body. Motor fitness is also known as ‘skill related fitness’ and this gives us a clue as to how these qualities help us when playing a game.
