An experiment to find the effect of exercise on pulse rate GCSE From markedbyteachers.com
A swelling in the carotid. Exercise causes an increase in pulse rate (heart rate). Basically i need to create a good question and testable hypothesis. Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat — which means it doesn&#39;t have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise.

<p>With exercise or physical activity, the heart rate increases to supply the muscles with more oxygen to produce extra energy. Exercise causes an increase in pulse rate (heart rate). Atp provides energy for processes such as muscle contraction (the process needed for exercise). In some subjects there is a secondary rise in all three items between 10 and 30 seconds after cessation of exercise.</p>

<p>Intense exercise causes a steeper increase in your heart rate than moderate exercise. When you are exercising, your muscles need extra oxygensome three times as much as resting muscles. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit.

<p>When you are exercising, your muscles need extra oxygensome three times as much as resting muscles. When exercising our muscles contract more often and require more energy. Chronic exercise training produces a resting bradycardia that is thought to be due partly to enhanced vagal modulation. Basically i need to create a good question and testable hypothesis.
