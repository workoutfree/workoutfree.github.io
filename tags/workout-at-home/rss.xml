&lt;p&gt;Most people with fat loss goals, in addition to their lifting program, do at least 3 to 4 days a week of formal cardio, usually 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate to moderately hard intensity (enough to get heart rate and breathing up). As you can see in the graph below, the longer your cardio, the more cardio tends to interfere with muscle and strength gain. A combination of cardio and weights may be best for improving your body composition. You can safely do some type of cardio every day of the week, but if you are also weight training then you are better off alternating days instead of trying to do cardio and weight training on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
