This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. An cardiolipin igg test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. One can test for all isotypes at once, or they can be detected separately. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].
