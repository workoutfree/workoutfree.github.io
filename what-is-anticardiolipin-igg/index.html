This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. An cardiolipin igg test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. One can test for all isotypes at once, or they can be detected separately. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].

In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart.
