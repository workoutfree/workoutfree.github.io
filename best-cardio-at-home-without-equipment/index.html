This exercise is sure to get your blood pumping. Burpees suck, they make you feel tired but they are anaerobic, not aerobic, so they aren’t really great for aerobic ‘cardio.’ they also aren’t really for beginners. Lower your foot and repeat with the left heel. (in fact, dancing can burn a great deal of calories, enhance your muscle strength, and get your muscles nice and toned!) whether you choose salsa, zumba, hip hop, or something else, dancing is such great exercise.
