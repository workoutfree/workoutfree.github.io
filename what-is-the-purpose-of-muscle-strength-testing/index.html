<p>An additional purpose for isokinetic testing is to determine the relationship of muscular strength to functional performance. As a consequence, muscle function, athletic profiles, or functional movement performance assessed by tested muscle strength have been often confounded by the effect of body size. Strength is the ability to carry out work against a resistance. This can occur when a muscle is paralyzed, such as after a stroke, spinal cord injury, or cervical or lumbar radiculopathy.
