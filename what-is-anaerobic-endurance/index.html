Anaerobic Training, Sprint to Success Firstbeat From firstbeat.com
This type of exercise leads to a buildup of lactic acid. Still, training at or a little above anaerobic threshold intensity is known to improve both the aerobic capacity and the anaerobic threshold level. During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods. Anaerobic exercise may be used to help build endurance, muscle strength, and power.

<p>The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. The anaerobic threshold is the highest exercise intensity that you can sustain for a prolonged period without lactate substantially building up in your blood. When our body is working anaerobically, the intensity is too high for oxygen to sustain the activity it demands. Anaerobic endurance training focuses on the physiological improvements in the muscles’ ability to endure force output through both neural and metabolic mechanisms.

<p>Aerobic endurance is one of the two forms of resistance of the human body , that is, its ability to continuously perform an activity or work for as long as possible. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods.
