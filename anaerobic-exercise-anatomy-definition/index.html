GCSE PE Applied Anatomy and Physiology, Anaerobic and Aerobic Exercise From tes.com
When the body is resting, the body is quickly trying to get oxygen into the muscles to nourish, repair and clear the waste products in the muscles. Anaerobic capacity, anaerobic work capacity and anaerobic potential, and develop a systems perspective of anaerobic capacity. Sprinting is a fantastic way to burn fat by exerting energy in bursts. During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (at).

<p>Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. [adjective] living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen. Anaerobic exercise (anaerobic meaning “without oxygen”) can be defined as exercise in which the body goes all out and the muscles rely heavily on production of energy without adequate oxygen.

<p>Respiratory system supplies energy very quickly for sports such as vaulting in gymnastics or throwing a javelin where the activity only lasts a few. Anaerobic exercise (anaerobic meaning “without oxygen”) can be defined as exercise in which the body goes all out and the muscles rely heavily on production of energy without adequate oxygen. The purpose of this paper is both to define terms used in exercise physiology, i.e. Anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel.
