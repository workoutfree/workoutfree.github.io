Lesser levels of igg and igm phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies and antibodies of the iga isotype may occur in patients with clinical signs of aps but the results. Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings suggest that the patient. There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more.

An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. Cardiolipin antibodies (ca) are seen in a subgroup of patients with autoimmune disorders, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), who are at risk for vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral infarct and/or recurrent.
