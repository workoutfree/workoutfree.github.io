Ischemic heart disease 2012 ji li From slideshare.net
Cardiac ischemia may be asymptomatic or may cause chest pain, known as angina pectoris.it occurs when the heart muscle, or myocardium, receives insufficient blood flow. Acute cardiac ischemia is defined by new or worsening imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, most commonly in the setting of coronary artery disease. Ischaemia can occur in any part of the body; A shortage of blood and oxygen can lead to serious consequences on the affected tissues, which can eventually become necrotic.
