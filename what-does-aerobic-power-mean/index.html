This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration. Aerobic means “in the presence of oxygen”.this is the type of running you do when you feel “slow” and comfortable. So, we’ve been talking a ton about developing everyone’s capacity in this upcoming cycle, but we’re sure that its all mumble jumble to most people. Aerobic power is the ability of the muscles to use oxygen received form the heart and lungs to produce energy.

<p>Aerobic metabolism is the process of extracting energy from the carbohydrate sources such as fatty acids, amino acids. It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen.

<p>Aerobic power is the ability of the muscles to use oxygen received form the heart and lungs to produce energy. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise. Therefore aerobic power is usually monitored and tested using vo2 max. More efficient this process becomes, aerobic power improves.

<p>When running aerobically, your muscles can get enough oxygen from the blood to process the energy in the cells (burning fat in most cases). Aerobic metabolism consists of two different pathways, the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, both of which occur in the mitochondria, the energy factories of cells. The human body has 3 main methods for using energy to sustain itself and fuel exercise. The product of respiration is a molecule called adenosine.

<p>More efficient this process becomes, aerobic power improves. Aerobic capacity, also known as cardiopulmonary capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, or vo2 max, is a measurement of your maximum oxygen consumption during physical activity. It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Top Benefits of Cardio How Aerobic Training Benefits Your Body.</p>

<p>Aerobic metabolism consists of two different pathways, the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, both of which occur in the mitochondria, the energy factories of cells. When running aerobically, your muscles can get enough oxygen from the blood to process the energy in the cells (burning fat in most cases). This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration. Lactic acid is produced by the body during exercise and is cleared from the blood by the liver.
