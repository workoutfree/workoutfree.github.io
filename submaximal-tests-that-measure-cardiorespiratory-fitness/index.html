Mayo clin proc, 90 (2015), pp. This test should be administered by an exercise specialist as it requires specific procedures and equipment, including a cycle ergometer and a blood. Improvements in submaximal measures of cardiorespiratory fitness are observed in the absence of change in mcrf. Submaximal tests usually aim for just above 75% of the participant&#39;s predicted.
