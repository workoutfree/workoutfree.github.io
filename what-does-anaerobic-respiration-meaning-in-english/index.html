<p>Simply, anaerobic respiration can be defined as the cellular respiration process occurring in an anoxic environment i.e. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. A chemical process in which energy is produced in the body from food by using oxygen 2.</p>
