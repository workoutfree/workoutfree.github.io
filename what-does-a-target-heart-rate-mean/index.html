Heart rate, also called pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Once you know your maximum heart rate, you can calculate your desired target heart rate zone — the level at which your heart is being exercised and conditioned but not overworked. This tool gives you a range of what your target heart rate is, based on how much you usually. The american heart association recommends people to exercise in their target heart rate zones, which are.

<p>A target heart rate refers to what your heart rate should be while doing exercise, while a resting heart rate is the number of beats per minute (bpm) when at rest. The american heart association recommends people to exercise in their target heart rate zones, which are. At a 50 percent exertion level, your target would be 50 percent of that maximum, or 85 beats per minute.
