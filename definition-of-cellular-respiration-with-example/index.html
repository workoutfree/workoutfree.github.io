Steps of the Cellular Respiration Cycle ABC Worksheet From abcworksheet.com
Basically, cellular respiration means converting food molecules into energy(in the form of atp) through chemical reaction which needs oxygen for breaking up this food molecules. Molecular oxygen is the most efficient electron acceptor for respiration, due to. The overall equation of anaerobic respiration is: The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release of energy is called cellular respiration.
