A layer chicken needs to eat or consume 110 grams or 0.110 kg of feed. For dairy animals, the product is milk, measured in pints or litres of milk. The feed conversion ratio (fcr) and residual feed intake (rfi) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. And in cage than in floor housing.

<p>The economic conversion ratio (ecr, $/kg fish) provides a measure of feed economic efficiency by multiplying fcr and feeds cost. The following guidelines can help the farmer to make the right feed at each stage of growth: Feed conversion ratio for cattle is 12.5. Specifically, fcr may be defined as weight gain divided by feed intake. New Zealandâs Tegel Poultry achieves worldâs best feed conversion.</p>

<p>Calculating fcr is as simple as taking the total amount of feed consumed by the flock and dividing it by the amount of weight gained or the number of eggs produced. It was hypothesised that variation in. This means that when a feed has a low fcr, it takes less feed to produce one kilogram of fish then it would if the fcr were higher. Depending on the country and species concerned, the proportion of feed in a broilerâs ration ranges from 40 to 70% of the cost of production. Layers Feed Intake and Weight/Growth Chart.</p>
