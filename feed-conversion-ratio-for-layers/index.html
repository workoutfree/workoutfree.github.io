A layer chicken needs to eat or consume 110 grams or 0.110 kg of feed. For dairy animals, the product is milk, measured in pints or litres of milk. The feed conversion ratio (fcr) and residual feed intake (rfi) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. And in cage than in floor housing.

<p>The economic conversion ratio (ecr, $/kg fish) provides a measure of feed economic efficiency by multiplying fcr and feeds cost. The following guidelines can help the farmer to make the right feed at each stage of growth: Feed conversion ratio for cattle is 12.5. Specifically, fcr may be defined as weight gain divided by feed intake. New Zealand’s Tegel Poultry achieves world’s best feed conversion.</p>

It was hypothesised that variation in. This means that when a feed has a low fcr, it takes less feed to produce one kilogram of fish then it would if the fcr were higher. Depending on the country and species concerned, the proportion of feed in a broiler’s ration ranges from 40 to 70% of the cost of production. Layers Feed Intake and Weight/Growth Chart.</p>

<p>How is the poultry feed conversion ratio defined for broilers/45 day chickens and layers? Normal laying hens don't get fat, even with free choice feed. Depending on the country and species concerned, the proportion of feed in a broiler’s ration ranges from 40 to 70% of the cost of production.

Feed conversion ratio is a measure to determine the productivity and efficiency of an animal. He also shares common conventions and “rule of thumb” values regarding layers, such as the amount of feeds that a layer consumes in its lifetime, how many eggs are produced by 1kg of feeds, and many more.
