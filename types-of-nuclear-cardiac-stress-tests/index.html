Cardiovascular Tests And Procedures From expertchikitsa.com
The nuclear stress test is most often used to look for blockages. Together, ct scans and nuclear medicine tests of the heart account for virtually all of. There are two types of nuclear stress tests, one that is used in conjunction with exercise (exercise stress test) and one that is used in conjunction with medication (pharmacologic stress test). These tests are also called heart perfusion imaging tests or cardiac nuclear stress scans.

<p>Images (or pictures) are taken of the heart while at rest and after the heart is stressed. It uses ultrasound to study how the heart contracts and pumps blood while under stress. Images of the heart are acquired when the heart is in a baseline resting state and again after the heart has been exercised, or stressed. These symptoms can occur during a stress test.

A cardiac stress test (also referred to as a cardiac diagnostic test, cardiopulmonary exercise test, or abbreviated cpx test) is a cardiological test that measures the heart's ability to respond to external stress  in a controlled clinical environment. This type of stress test helps us better assess the structures of the heart by doing an echocardiogram before, during and after a treadmill or bike stress test.
