They are generally associated with a condition called the phospholipid antibody syndrome. In general, all patients who test positive for. Isolated iga acl are not very common, therefore their testing could. If there is a clotting issue that is known, then the negative result indicates that there is another reason behind the blood clots that are occurring.
