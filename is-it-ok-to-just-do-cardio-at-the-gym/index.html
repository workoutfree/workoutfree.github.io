These workouts put a lot of stress on your muscles and joints. All in all, there&#39;s no need to do cardio every time you work out. Because of this, it&#39;s a lot easier for me to hit the weights before i get my cardio in, because that way i don&#39;t get the benches and machines as soaking with my sweat. Cycle on an actual bike instead of at the gym, it&#39;s much more fun and you feel like you&#39;ve accomplished more as you&#39;ve actually moved.
