Gymnosperms include three basic groups of trees that are rooted in ancient times: Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. Two kinds of vascular tissue occur in plants:

<p>That characteristic is that their embryos contain tissues from the mother plant to prevent desiccation (drying out). There are two kinds of vascular tissue system in plants, and they are called phloem and xylem. Roots anchor the plant in the ground and transport minerals and water into the plant. The sporophyte is diploid, bearing two sets of chromosomes per cell. Overview NonVascular Plants â¢ Phylum Bryophyta â¢ Phylum Hepatophyta.</p>

<p>Vascular plant, also called tracheophyte, any of some 260,000 species of plants with vascular systems, including all of the conspicuous flora of earth today. Vascular plants are those plants, which have specialised vascular tissues for the transport of water, minerals and food. Their characteristic organs are roots, stem and leaves. Vascular plants are a group of plants characterized by having a vascular system, having true leaves, roots, etc., and having a dominant sporophyte (diploid) generation.
