Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake.

<p>Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. The test measures igg and igm levels. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. Rituximab in thrombotic primary antiphospholipid syndrome a pilot.</p>

<p>A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individualâs immune system attacks their red blood cells. Some RE patients have additional potentiallypathogenic autoimmune ab's.</p>
