Aerobic Exercise Guidelines Set By The Acsm Aerobic Exercise Video From infoaerobicexercise.blogspot.com
Aerobic exercise is continuous whole body rhythmic exercise that involves the large muscle groups of the body. However, aerobic training programs should be designed to match each athlete’s fitness level. Exercise between 3 and 5 times per week. The objectives were to propose a new strategy for adjusting aerobic training variables based on the eighth american college of sports medicine (acsm) guidelines and maximal aerobic power (&amp;ov0312;o2max) and to establish energy expenditure (ee) recommendations for training, which depend on a subject&#39;s body mass (bm).
