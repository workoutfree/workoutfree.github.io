Cellular Respiration Process From abcworksheet.com
Aerobe, an organism able to live and reproduce only in the presence of free oxygen (e.g., certain bacteria and certain yeasts). During the respiration process in plants, the oxygen gas enters the plant cells through the stomata, which is found in the epidermis of leaves and stem of a plant. Aerobic bacteria types • obligate aerobes require o2 for cellular respiration to oxidise substrates—e.g., sugars and fats to obtain energy.

<p>Although some aerobic organisms, such as animals, breathe in oxygen through lungs or gills, other organisms, like plants, fungi, and bacteria, are also aerobic. Aerobic is a condition in which free oxygen or dissolved oxygen is present in an aquatic environment. However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen.
