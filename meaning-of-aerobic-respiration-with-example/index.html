Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives.
Aerobic Respiration Definition, Equation Steps, Examples, Formula From embibe.com
In the aerobic respiration process oxygen molecules are used as the last electron acceptor molecule. For vigorous exercise our heart and lungs. It is a type of respiration that requires oxygen to occur, and produces water, carbon dioxide and atp. In living cells, a process that uses oxygen to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy.

<p>This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. In living cells, a process that uses oxygen to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy. Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences.</p>

<p>The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. In the aerobic respiration process oxygen molecules are used as the last electron acceptor molecule. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. The meaning of the word aerobic is with air.

<p>This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Muscles need oxygen and glucose to respire aerobically and produce. Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules. Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences.</p>
