1.2.2. Lesson 3 long term effects part 1 From slideshare.net
Lack of physical activity can add to feelings of anxiety and depression. Long term exercise leads to physiologic remodeling of the heart, including adaptive molecular and cellular reprogramming, that have cardioprotective effect. We aimed to evaluate the impact of physical activity level on mortality at long term in stable chd patients. In the long run, physical activity may increase your lifespan and improve cardiovascular function.
