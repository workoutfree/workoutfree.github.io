I want to build muscle, but I enjoy cardio and don&#39;t want to gain From yahoo.com
Incurring small deficits of 250 to 500 calories, or even incurring deficits of 1,000 calories for larger, more active people, will encourage your body to use stored fat for energy so you will lose weight. More recent research suggests that moderate amounts of cardio can actually boost the effects of strength training. Although there are studies showing that high intensity forms of cardio may contribute to weight loss, it is not a sustainable method. You need to find a balance between cardio and weight training so that you can work on your cardiovascular endurance without it taking away from your muscle.
