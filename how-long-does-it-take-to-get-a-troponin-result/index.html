<p>The reference ranges for the troponin test, according to the american board of internal medicine, are measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). Treatment for high troponin levels involves resolving the underlying health problem that’s causing levels to rise (heart disease, infection, etc.). Troponin in blood continues to remain raised up to 2 weeks thus providing a greater time range to detect the problem. Some specialist test results may take longer, if samples have to be sent to a reference (specialist) laboratory.</p>
