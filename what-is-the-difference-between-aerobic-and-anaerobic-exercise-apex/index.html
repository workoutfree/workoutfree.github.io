Differences Between Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Science Life From meritnation.com
The difference lies in metabolics. More specifically aerobic exercise uses oxygen to produce energy and anaerobic exercise does not use oxygen to produce energy. The opposite of aerobic exercise is anaerobic and actually translates to ‘without oxygen’. Anaerobic, or “without oxygen,” exercise is done at a very high intensity for a short period of time.
