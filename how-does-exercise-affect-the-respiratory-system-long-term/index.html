The increased rate and depth of breathing increases the rate of gaseous exchange in the lungs.
Respiration From slideshare.net
The higher rate of muscle contraction depletes energy stores and so stimulates a higher rate of energy metabolism. The body’s energy stores are slowly depleted. Movement take place in the body by doing exercise which causes quick excretion of poisonous products from the body in the form of sweat and urine. Myoglobin releases its stored oxygen to use in aerobic respiration.

<p>The respiratory system is the set of organs that allows a person to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body. • there is an increase in lung volume • vital capacity is increased (max inspiration) • tidal volume increases during exercise • respiratory muscles get stronger become more efficient lungs get bigger. The lungs also benefit from exercise by getting more air into them and therefore flushing out mucus and other debris.

<p>How does exercise affect the gas exchange system? The effects of exercise on the respiration system are as follows : Movement take place in the body by doing exercise which causes quick excretion of poisonous products from the body in the form of sweat and urine. More forceful heart contractions with each heartbeat, which leads to. Respiration.</p>
<h3 id="the-effects-of-exercise-on-the-respiration-system-are-as-follows-">The Effects Of Exercise On The Respiration System Are As Follows :</h3><p>This leads to an increased heart rate and increased circulation, which gets oxygenated blood to your muscles quicker. There are a number of changes that occur in the respiratory system when we take part in physical activity (while exercising). In the long run, physical activity may increase your lifespan and improve cardiovascular function. Myoglobin releases its stored oxygen to use in aerobic respiration.</p>
<h3 id="the-lungs-cannot-move-on-their-own">The Lungs Cannot Move On Their Own.</h3><p>This means more oxygen is able to enter the body and go to the working muscles so they can work harder and more diffusion can occur so there are less waste products such as lactic acid. Since breathing is controlled by co2, the usual exercise effects for fit and healthy people are simple: The muscles store glucose as glycogen. The lungs are spongy organs situated on either side of the breastbone in the chest.</p>
<h3 id="this-has-the-effect-of-increasing-the-amount-of-oxygen-that-can-be-transferred-to-the-working-muscles-as">This Has The Effect Of Increasing The Amount Of Oxygen That Can Be Transferred To The Working Muscles As.</h3><p>O2 can now be diffused into the muscle from the capillaries more. This keeps the body diseases free. When this happens, thoracic restriction becomes even worse, and you can’t take as deep a. Short term effects of exercise on the muscles.</p>
<h3 id="during-strenuous-exercise-oxygen-diffusion-may-increase-by-as-much-as-threefold-above-the-resting-level">During Strenuous Exercise, Oxygen Diffusion May Increase By As Much As Threefold Above The Resting Level.</h3><p>As exercise intensity increases, greater demands are placed on the respiratory muscles, making them work harder on inspiration (inhale) and expiration (exhale). With long term exercise vital capacity increases, this means that the amount of air that is able to be forced in and out in one breath will increase. At some point, they can’t keep up, and the powers that aid in breathing become fatigued. The increased heart rate increases the rate of blood flow around the body.</p>
