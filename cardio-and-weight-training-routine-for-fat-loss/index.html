You can use low intensity early morning cardio or hiit (high intensity interval training) in the evenings. For women, protein intake should be a minimum of 100 grams per day. Most people with fat loss goals, in addition to their lifting program, do at least 3 to 4 days a week of formal cardio, usually 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate to moderately hard intensity (enough to get heart rate and breathing up). This workout is designed for people who have finished bulking and have some excess fat they&#39;d like to lose.
