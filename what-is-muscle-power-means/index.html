The mrc scale of muscle strength uses a score of 0 to 5 to grade the power of a particular muscle. Muscle temperature also has an interesting effect on your power. This will avoid the swinging issue but you need. Power can be defined as force × distance/time or force × velocity ().force (i.e., strength) plays a key role in power production and if not maintained with training can result in a decrease or no change in power production.
