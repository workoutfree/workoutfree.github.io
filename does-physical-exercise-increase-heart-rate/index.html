<p>They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week). Your heart rate rises and your pulse quickens, showing that your cardiovascular system is active. Your resting pulse naturally increases as you get older, but your maximum heart rate decreases. Dehydration also increases heart rate during exercise.</p>
