Hi ally, it is true, as others have told you, that pvcs are premature ventricular contractions, early beats that originate in one of the two lower chambers of the heart instead of in the sinoatrial (sa) node in the r upper chamber (atrium) of the heart which is the heart's normal natural pacemaker. Pvcs are characterized by the premature occurrence of a wide qrs complex that is bizarre in shape.

<p>Those that start in the lower chambers are premature ventricular contractions, or pvcs. However pvc and psvc may stand for premature ventricular (bottom heart chamber) and supraventricular (top heart chamber) contractions; The abbreviation pvcu stands for poly vinyl chloride.
