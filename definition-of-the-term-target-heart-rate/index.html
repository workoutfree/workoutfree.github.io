Target Heart Rate Range Definition TRGOTA From trgota.blogspot.com
A target heart rate refers to what your heart rate should be while doing exercise, while a resting heart rate is the number of beats per minute (bpm) when at rest. These ranges can vary depending on your age and general health. The more athletic and fit you are, the lower that number is likely to be, sometimes getting down to 40 to 50 bpm. The target heart rate zone is a term used to define a heart rate at which cardio exercises are to be done.
