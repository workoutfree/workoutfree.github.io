Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. By definition, aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.”. By definition, aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.”.

The maximal amount of physiological work that an individual can do as measured by oxygen consumption. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. Maximum aerobic work capacity (vo2 max) is a clinical standard for measuring cardiorespiratory efficiency in graduated stages by increasing the duration and intensity levels where the gaseous exchange between oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide expulsion reaches the maximum threshold to sustain physical exertion.
