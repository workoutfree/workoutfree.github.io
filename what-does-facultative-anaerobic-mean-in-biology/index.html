<p>They have adapted to live in either world. What is facultative and example? What does facultative anaerobic mean in biology? My guess is that anaerobes simply refer to organisms that can use things like c e n o 3 −, c e s o 4 2 − to respirate, aerobes simply refer to organisms that can use c e o 2 to respirate, and facultative refers to how they can tolerate the condition opposite to the one they can use.
