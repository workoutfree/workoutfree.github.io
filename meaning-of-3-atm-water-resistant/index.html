<meta name="description" content="Easy Meaning Of 3 Atm Water Resistant For Diet, 30 metres (3atm) a very common rating among dress watches, if your timepiece says 30 metres or 3atm (atm meaning atmospheres) then it does not mean it’s water resistant to 30 metres below sea level. Stated in units of pressure such as atmospheres (atms), or depth such as meters, water resistance levels typically range from 3 atm (30 meters) to 20 atm (200 meters) and diver&#39;s watches at 200&#43; meters.
Water Resistant Watch Guide Shiels Jewellers From shiels.com.au
It’s a measure of the watch’s resistance to pressure. The atm used here stands for “atmosphere.”. Atm or “atmospheres” is the amount of pressure a watch can withstand. One atmosphere is equal to 1.01325 bar, or what we at time bum laboratories call, “close enough.”.
