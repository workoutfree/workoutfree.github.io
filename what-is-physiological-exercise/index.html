Physiological fitness can be defined as fitness relating to the physical aspects of the human body. Exercise physiologists play a crucial role in the health and wellness of individuals of all ages and physical capacities. During physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal of metabolites and carbon dioxide. It is often directed toward also the honing of athletic ability or skill.

<p>Sports physiology uses this information to: The second important physiological change experienced by the cardiovascular system due to exercise is the reduction of blood pressure. Learn and reinforce your understanding of physiological changes during exercise. During physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal of metabolites and carbon dioxide.

<p>What physiological changes occur to the body during exercise? Rehabilitation is the overall process of working to reduce pain or regain functionality after having an injury, illness or operation. Exercise physiology research has found fat as the major energy source during rest and light exercise and carbohydrates (cho) increasingly becomes the primary source as exercise intensity increases. The physiological benefits associated with regular physical activity participation range from risk reductions for several diseases and health maladies, to improvements in mobility, fitness, and overall quality of life (kravitz, 2007).
