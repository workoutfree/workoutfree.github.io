The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity. However, a higher concentration of antibodies may be a strong indication of autoimmune disease [ 5 ]. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form.

<p>A negative result means only that cardiolipin antibodies are not present or not present at a detectable level in the blood at the time of the test. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). I have included the bloodwork of the cardiolipin tests. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).</p>

<p>An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. The immunoglobulin m (igm) antibody is the largest among the five major types of immunoglobulins and is the first antibody that is created by the body to fight infections. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time.
