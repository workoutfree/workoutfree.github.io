<p>Homeostasis is the overall equilibrium of the bodyâs internal organs and functions. The circulatory system works with the respiratory system to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen. The circulatory system maintains homeostasis, by the controlled and continuous flow of blood that reaches each cell in the body. The respiratory system helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the intake of air into the body and by removing carbon dioxide from the blood, which in turn assists the circulatory systemâs function and many other operations in the body.
