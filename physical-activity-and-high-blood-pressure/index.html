Physical activity should be improved to the relatively high level to be effective in controlling blood pressure. Conversely, regular practice of physical activity decreases very significantly the risk by up to 60%. Increased physical activity is often the initial treatment of choice for patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure. Certainly, cutting out unhealthy, sodium rich foods and eating balanced meals will have some effect on high blood pressure, but for the most effective treatment, engaging in adequate physical activity can bring blood pressure down to normal ranges, at least in people whose hypertension was caused in part by unhealthy lifestyle choices.
