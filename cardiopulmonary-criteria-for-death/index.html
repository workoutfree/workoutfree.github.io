Declared dead by cardiopulmonary criteria, or donors declared brain dead by neurologic criteria. With all the controversy surrounding neurological criteria for death, the traditional criteria related to heartbeat and breathing have remained largely unchanged and undisputed except in the university of pittsburgh medical center's program in which organs are taken from certain patients as soon as possible after expected cardiopulmonary death.

<p>What are the cardiopulmonary criteria for defining death? Therefore, the minimum determination of death criteria should be rigorous, global, and acceptable for medical practice worldwide, while remaining respectful of diversities. Due to advances in cardiac resuscitation and sustaining mechanical ventilation even after cessation of brain function, the brain death criteria has been added to the determination of death (bernat, et al., 2010). Nurses certified in acls are also expected to assess for the underlying causes of cardiac arrest. Figure 2 from 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline for management of patients.</p>
