Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. Anaerobic respiration is when the body produces energy without the presence of oxygen. During this process, instead of producing just carbon dioxide and water as a waste product, it also produces.

<p>The difference between aerobic and anaerobic training is the fuel source. Anaerobic exercise is said to strengthen muscles, increase joint mobility and reduce risk of musculoskeletal injury. Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise.</p>
