<p>The aerobic cellular respiration equation depicts glucose (c 6 h 12 o 6) combining with oxygen (o 2) and adp to form carbon dioxide. Cellular respiration is defined as the conversion of fuel into energy and nutrients within the mitochondria and cytosol of cells. It is the process of exchange between environmental oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body cells without any need for special respiratory organs or blood. Aerobic respiration is a biological function that all humans and a lot of other organisms experience.</p>

<p>Molecular oxygen is the most efficient electron acceptor for respiration, due to. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that seem to directly oppose each other.

<p>This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release of energy is called cellular respiration. Carbon dioxide produces acidic ions in an aqueous solution. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration sciencemusicvideos.</p>
