The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to the heart. The build up of atheroma on the walls of the coronary arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts the flow of blood to the heart. Coronary heart disease (chd) is usually caused by a build up of fatty deposits on the walls of the coronary arteries. If the oxygen depletion is extreme, the effect may be a myocardial infarction.
