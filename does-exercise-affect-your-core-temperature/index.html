This is because only approximately 20% of the energy produced in contracting muscles is used for muscle contraction; The remaining 80% is converted to heat energy, and therefore exercise causes an increase in muscle temperature. In addition, as the core temperature increases during exercise, larger proportions of the blood volume are distributed to the cutaneous vessels, thus effectively reducing cardiac return and central blood volume.</p>
