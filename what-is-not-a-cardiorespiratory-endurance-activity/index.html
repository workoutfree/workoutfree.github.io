Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy production needed during physical activity. (pacer), a variation on the shuttle run, is a maximal cardiorespiratory endurance test in which lines are placed 15 or 20 meters apart, and the participant runs repeatedly between the two lines within prescribed times. In 2016, the american heart association published an official scientific statement advocating that crf be categorized as a clinical vital sign and should be routinely. What is the test most often used to assess cardiorespiratory endurance?
