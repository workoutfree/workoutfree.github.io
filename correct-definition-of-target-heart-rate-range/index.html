Heart Rate 39 Beats Per Minute Rating Walls From ratingwalls.blogspot.com
For most of us, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. The figures are averages, so use them as a general guide. A target heart rate refers to what your heart rate should be while doing exercise, while a resting heart rate is the number of beats per minute (bpm) when at rest. Exercise heart rates below the 70% threshold are generally offset by extending exercise duration.
