<p>What 10atm or 5atm wr rating actually means. Water resistance levels for smart watches are specified from 3 atm to 20 atm. It is important to note that this is a measure of pressure not depth. 30 metres (3atm) a very common rating among dress watches, if your timepiece says 30 metres or 3atm (atm meaning atmospheres) then it does not mean itâs water resistant to 30 metres below sea level.</p>
