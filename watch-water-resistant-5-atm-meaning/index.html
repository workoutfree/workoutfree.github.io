<p>What 10atm or 5atm wr rating actually means. Water resistance levels for smart watches are specified from 3 atm to 20 atm. It is important to note that this is a measure of pressure not depth. 30 metres (3atm) a very common rating among dress watches, if your timepiece says 30 metres or 3atm (atm meaning atmospheres) then it does not mean it’s water resistant to 30 metres below sea level.</p>

<p>Water resistant 100 meters / 10 atmospheres / 10 bar. The simple answer is that 3 atm water resistant means that a watch is water resistant to a depth of 30 meters. If you dunk it in the sink doing the dishes or accidentally wear into the shower, there is a good chance it will leak and / or fog up. Can be worn in a shower. ATM Explanation.</p>
