Support of cardiopulmonary function with mechanical ventilation has traditionally involved intermittent application of positive pressure to the patient's airway. Cardiac cycle is defined as the sequence of events in a complete heartbeat that involve the alternative contraction and relaxation of atria and ventricles in order to pump the blood throughout the body organs.
