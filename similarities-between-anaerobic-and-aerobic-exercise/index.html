<p>Depending on the result you. Similarities and differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration cellular respiration is a process that takes place inside the cells where the breakdown of glucose molecules releases energy. Anaerobic activity does not require oxygen for fuel while aerobic activity depends on oxygen for fuel. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you‚Äôre training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy.

<p>During anaerobic exercise, you burn calories and improve your cardiovascular health, just like during aerobic exercise. This process consumes 2 atp molecules and produces 4 for each glucose molecule, so the net gain is 2atp molecules. During exercise you can easily tell the difference between the two forms of activity by how you feel. Aerobic training is for improving circulation and your body's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Anaerobic VS Aerobic 4th Period 2015 Phillips J.</p>
