Introduction to Complex Systems From serc.carleton.edu
Let us begin with the oceans and large water bodies. The cycle of processes by which water circulates between the earth&#39;s oceans, atmosphere, and land, involving precipitation as rain and snow, drainage in streams and rivers, and return to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration. What is the water cycle in 100 words? Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

<p>What does water cycle mean in a sentence? The cycle starts when water on the surface of the earth evaporates. As the water heats up, it evaporates (turns from liquid to vapor). Precipitation is the most obvious stage of the water cycle for most children. Water Savers Water cycle game, Water cycle, Science lessons.</p>

<p>The water cycle refers to the cycle that describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the earth. (physical geography) the circulation of the earth's water, in which water evaporates from the sea into the atmosphere, where it condenses and falls as rain or snow, returning to the sea by rivers or returning to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) is the cycle that water goes through on earth. Or in more scientific terms: The Water Cycle Final Product.</p>

<p>Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. The water cycle or hydrologic cycle describes the complex systems that allow water to move across the earth and atmosphere. The sun heats up water on land, in rivers, lakes and seas and turns it into water vapour. The warming of water from the sun causes the evaporation of liquid water molecules into water vapour that moves up into the atmosphere.
