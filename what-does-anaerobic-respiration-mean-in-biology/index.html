<p>During respiration, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor at the end of an electron transport chain, which is why aerobic organisms must breathe air containing oxygen in order to survive. Actinomyces, clostridium, propionibacterium, bifidobacterium, bacteroides fusobacterium etc. Respiration all organisms respire in order to release energy to fuel their living processes. In aerobic respiration complete oxidation of glucose takes place. Cellular Respiration.</p>

<p>Like other anaerobic organisms, anaerobic bacteria do not require oxygen for respiration. This series of biochemical reactions is also called a âmetabolic pathway.â two types of cellular respiration exist: In aerobic respiration complete oxidation of glucose takes place. More detailed differences between the two are as follows: cellular respiration How is NAD+ used in lactic acid fermentation.</p>

<p>Examples of anaerobic organisms include: Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy.
