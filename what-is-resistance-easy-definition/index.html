OhmG! Ohm’s Law Explained for Vapers EcigaretteReviewed From ecigarettereviewed.com
This formula is known as ohm’s law. Resistance is that property of a conductor which tends to hold or restrict the flow of an electric current, it is encountered in every circuit. Current is the aggregate flow of electrons through a wire and can be defined as the rate of electron flow. Conversely, the resistance value will increase as the current decreases.
