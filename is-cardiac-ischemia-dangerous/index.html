Silent ischemia may also disturb the heart’s rhythm. Ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, is the term given to heart problems caused by narrowed heart arteries. When these arteries are narrowed, less blood and oxygen reach the heart muscle, leading to severe complications. Atrial fibrillation (afib or af) is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when an abnormal electrical signal interferes with the heart’s normal pumping function.
