An organism can merely reproduce and create viable offspring. Charles darwin outlined the mechanisms of how species change, by natural selection and sexual selection. Genetically regulated traits that boost an individual’s potential. Two distinct colour forms of the pupae are found, namely brown and green, with very few intermediates.

<p>Evolutionary fitness is how well a species is able to survive and reproduce in its environment. The ability of an organism to create offspring. So based on evolutionary theory, we would expect organisms to evolve adaptations that would allow them to have more children, grand children. For example, according to maynard smith, fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals—for example homozygous for allele a at a particular locus.thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the.
