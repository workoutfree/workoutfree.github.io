<p>As you can probably imagine from the definition of cellular respiration mentioned above, this is a process that is pretty important to an awful lot of different organisms. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). Cellular respiration involves quite a few enzyme mediated reactions. Processes that take place in the cells and tissues during which energy is released and carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed by the blood to be transported to the lungs.
