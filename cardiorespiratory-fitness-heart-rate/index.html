Your target heart rate is 50 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. Estimating cardiorespiratory fitness from heart rates both during and after stepping exercise: Knowing what types of exercise and how. Cardiorespiratory fitness, typically measured as peak oxygen uptake (v̇o 2peak) during maximal graded exercise testing (gxt max), is a predictor of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease.however, measuring v̇o 2peak is costly and inconvenient and thus not widely used in clinical settings.

<p>Alternatively, postexercise heart rate recovery (hrrec), which. Crf estimation models were developed using heart rate (hr) features extracted from the resting, exercise, and the recovery phase. The importance of v ˙ o 2 max as predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality has been recently highlighted by a scientific statement issued by the american heart association. Cardiorespiratory fitness, typically measured as peak oxygen uptake (v̇o 2peak) during maximal graded exercise testing (gxt max), is a predictor of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease.however, measuring v̇o 2peak is costly and inconvenient and thus not widely used in clinical settings.
