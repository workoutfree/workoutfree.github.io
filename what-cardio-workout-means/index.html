Cardio is short for either “cardiovascular” or “cardiorespiratory”. Just about any physical activity you do can increase your heart rate, from lifting weights to strolling between your desk and the bathroom to rolling out of bed in the morning. This particular workout, recommended by rojas, is low to moderate intensity cardio. This means even short sessions of cardio a few times a day are helpful.
