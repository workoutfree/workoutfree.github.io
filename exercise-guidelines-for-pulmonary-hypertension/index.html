Effect of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy on ExerciseInduced From ahajournals.org
For many people, ph develops over time and is chronic. The other 15 folks in the study received standard care. However, in some people, the abnormal increase in blood pressure and other symptoms. Pulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic condition defined by an increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mpap) to at least 25 mm hg, which can result in dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance ().as patients with pulmonary hypertension often present with these nonspecific symptoms, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) can be a useful tool to suggest a.
