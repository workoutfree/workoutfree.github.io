One foot is 12 inches long, and the conversion factor of 1 foot to inches is 12. The same length is 0.3048 meters, and it is also 30.48 centimeters. In yards, 1 foot is equal to 1/3 yard (conversion factor of 1 foot to yards is 1/3) so forth. To calculate the mean you add all the values together and divide by the total number of values.
