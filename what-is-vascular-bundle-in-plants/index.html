<p>Within the vascular bundles, the xylem is located interior to the cambium ring, and the phloem is located. Xylem conducts water and mineral salts from the roots to the leaves. Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant.
