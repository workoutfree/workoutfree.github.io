<p>The higher intensity groups had more acidic blood at exhaustion, whereas the lower intensity groups had higher body temperatures at exhaustion. Fatigue during high intensity exercise is determined by the limitations of anaerobic metabolism that fuels these activities. It is worth noting, though, that there is no evidence to support the existence of eicf following periods of intense brief exercise. Neuromuscular fatigue was determined by preexercise to postexercise changes in maximal voluntary contraction force, voluntary activation level and contractile properties of the.</p>
