It is also called the aerobic colony count, standard plate count, mesophilic count or total plate count. Total plate, aerobic spore forming bacteria, yeast and mold count are presented in table. This count includes all pathogens and non pathogens and is used to determine the hygienic status of food. Total plate count is a measure of the biological activity in a sample.
