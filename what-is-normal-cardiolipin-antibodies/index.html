Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) titer levels (Mean±SD) of the GBS From researchgate.net
The quantitative measurement of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody is important in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated.
