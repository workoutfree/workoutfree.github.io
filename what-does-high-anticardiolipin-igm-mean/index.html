<p>What does a positive anticardiolipin igm mean? Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more. If it is very low, or other antibodies are also low (or not functioning), it may be a sign of immune deficiency that can lead to more infections.

<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin antibody tests are usually reported as a positive or negative result. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m).
