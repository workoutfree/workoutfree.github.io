<p>Oxygen carried by blood is used in cellular respiration and carbon dioxide released combines with hemoglobin in rbcs. The first step in is glycolysis, the second is the citric acid cycle and the third is the electron trans port system. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Aerobic respiration respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration. Respiration &amp; gas exchange.</p>
