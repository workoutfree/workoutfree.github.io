<p>Cardiac muscle tissue, also known as myocardium, is a structurally and functionally unique subtype of muscle tissue located in the heart, that actually has characteristics from both skeletal and muscle tissues.it is capable of strong, continuous, and rhythmic contractions that are automatically generated. These muscles are involuntary, it means they contract. Cardiac muscle (heart muscle) is a striated (striped) muscle found in the heart's walls. The contraction of individual cardiac muscle cells produces force and shortening in these bands of muscle, with a resultant decrease in the heart chamber.
