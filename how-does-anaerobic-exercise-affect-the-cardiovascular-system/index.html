Aerobic and anaerobic exercises are two types of exercise. By maintaining the aerobic phase of exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a week, the cardiorespiratory system can improve in. The idea is that a lot of energy. Aerobic exercise uses oxygen, and in addition to exercising the heart and lungs it burns fat, wards off disease and improves mood.
