<p>Adjustment of work load in response to increased physical fitness at the 10th week produced further reduction of blood pressure especially in diastole. Search results were limited to studies investigating. A small study finds that regular aerobic exercise may help these people lower their blood pressure. Thus, we attempt to identify those “nonresponders” to chronic exercise on the basis of their blood pressure (bp) responses to acute exercise (single session).
