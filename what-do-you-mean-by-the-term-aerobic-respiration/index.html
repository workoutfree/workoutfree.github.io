Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. Anaerobic respiration is respiration without oxygen; Cellular Respiration.</p>

<p>The process uses a respiratory electron transport chain but does not use oxygen as the electron acceptors. In this process, a food molecule breaks down. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Y7 Life 11 aerobic cellular respiration.</p>
