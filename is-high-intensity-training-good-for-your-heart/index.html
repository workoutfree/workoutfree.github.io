Can high intensity training be good for cardiac patients? health enews From ahchealthenews.com
While increased cardiovascular fitness helps to reduce your risk of heart disease, the benefits of high intensity training include improving blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. Doing such high intensity training may affect your heart and lead you to problems. This is indicating that strength training has unique and valuable benefits for heart health. However, conventional hypertrophy training (doing more sets and stopping just shy of failure) tends to be better for building muscle, has a lower risk of injury, and will have you doing more overall work—more exercise—which is better for your health.
