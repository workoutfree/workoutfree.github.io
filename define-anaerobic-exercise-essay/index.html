Only nine articles met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Significant amounts of oxygen are consumed by the human muscles when. Researchers have established that a person doing anaerobic workouts loses more calories than one doing aerobics on ratios of 5 to 1 or even 7 to 1.the aerobics burn up to around 25% muscle and 75% body fat while on the other hand, the anaerobic workouts tend to burn 100% body fat.</p>
