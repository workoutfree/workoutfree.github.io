Myocardial perfusion, also called nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging or nuclear stress test, is a nuclear cardiology procedure that involves, putting pharmaceutical radioactive tracers, a radioactive, into the muscle of the heart to show images of the nutritional blood flow to the muscles of the heart. For example, after a heart attack, it may be done to find areas of damaged heart muscle. It is done to show how well blood flows through the heart muscle. Cardiopulmonary bypass provides patients with cardiac and pulmonary support, while bypassing the heart and lungs.
