<p>There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting.</p>

<p>If the blood clot is. Aps is an autoimmune disorder that produces anticardiolipin antibodies. In general, all patients who test positive for aca should be retested after six to eight weeks to rule out transient antibodies that are usually of no clinical significance. A positive result supports the diagnosis only in the presence of thrombosis or fetal loss. Antiphospholipid syndrome an overview CMAJ.</p>

An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur.

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. The anticardiolipin blood test is useful in helping to determine if there is a risk for blood clots or help to explain clotting that has happened for some reason. There are different classes (isotypes) of anticardiolipin antibody, namely igg, igm, and iga. Specifics for collection of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody are as follows: Antiphospholipid antibodies.</p>

<p>A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. The antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).
