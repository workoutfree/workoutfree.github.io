Respiration From slideshare.net
The respiration, which takes place in the absence of oxygen, is known as anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that take place in the presence of oxygen, occurring in a cell to convert chemical energy into atps. Glycolysis, the link reaction, the krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy.
