Circulatory system, system that transports nutrients, respiratory gases, and metabolic products throughout the body.in humans, blood remains within a closed cardiovascular system composed of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.arteries carry blood away from the heart under high pressure exerted by the heart’s pumping action.
Respiratory and Circulatory Systems From slideshare.net
The system that moves blood throughout the body. Using the network of arteries, veins and capillaries, blood carries carbon dioxide to the lungs (for exhalation) and picks up oxygen. While arteries carry blood away from the heart, the veins (in most cases) carry blood back to the heart. The blood returns to the heart by way of the veins.
