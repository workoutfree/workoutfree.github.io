The velocity of conduction in most atrial muscle is about 0.3m/sec. The heart conduction system is the network of nodes, cells and signals that controls your heartbeat. Heart rate is the number of times the ventricles of the heart contract each minute. • the heart is endowed with a special system for (1) generating rhythmical electrical impulses to cause rhythmical contraction of the heart muscle (2) conducting these impulses rapidly through the heart.

<p>The specialized electrical conduction system of the heart allows for the synchronous contraction of the left and right sides of the heart and the sequential contraction of the atria and ventricles (figure 1 (b) ). The sinoatrial node, the heart’s pacemaker, initiates the heartbeat through sending an electrical impulse. Dysfunction of the conduction system can cause irregular heart rhythms including rhythms that are too fast or too slow. The human heart is an engine that has to work 24/7 to keep you alive, and it has to be reliable and effective.</p>
