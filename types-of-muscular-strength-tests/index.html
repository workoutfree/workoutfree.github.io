Grade 2&#43; is the beginning of strength ranges where there is a marked. Around 1880, physical testing shifted from anatomical proportions to muscular strength. The strength of specific muscle groups is tested against resistance, and one side of the body is compared with the other. Manual muscle testing (mmt) is the most common method by which clinicians evaluate muscle strength.
