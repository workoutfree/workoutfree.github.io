This allows the mechanisms within the circulatory system to ensure that every cell maintains a constant and balanced internal environment! The lymphatic system has the function of purifying the body fluids to prevent infections. The circulatory system maintains homeostasis by the controlled and continuous flow of blood that reaches each cell in the body. The respiratory system maintains homeostasis in two ways:
