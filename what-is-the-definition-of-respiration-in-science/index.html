Cellular respiration Definition and Examples Biology Online Dictionary From biologyonline.com
Cellular respiration is a chemical process that takes place inside cells and produces energy. The physical and chemical processes (such as breathing and diffusion) by which an organism supplies its cells and tissues with the oxygen needed for metabolism and relieves them of the carbon dioxide formed in energy. The process breaks bonds in sugars. First, respiration may refer to external respiration or the.
