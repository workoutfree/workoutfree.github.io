Thirty obese young males were divided randomly into three groups that either performed weights before cardio, cardio before weights, or didn’t exercise at all.

<p>If your goal is to get stronger, you need to separate your cardio. If you're running a couple dozen miles a week, it might not be as good for building muscle as focusing more on the strength training. Cardio after weights is ideal because during the weight workout you are depleting muscle glycogen, meaning that during the cardio you will be burning mostly fat. Keep in mind, though, that doing a long cardio session before lifting weights may slightly delay your recovery time—a good reason to give yourself a few days off afterward.

<p>My goal is 145 or so. If you're running a couple dozen miles a week, it might not be as good for building muscle as focusing more on the strength training.

<p>The reason you do weights first is because you cardio can hinder your strength training. I like the results of weight lifting better, but cardio helps me with stress. I'd like to do them both every day but i'm worried that i won't get the gains i'm looking for. So combining two independently designed group workouts really isn't at all similar to physically demanding labor, which is typically light cardio combined with varying degrees of weight lifting, depending on the job.

Cardio after weights is ideal because during the weight workout you are depleting muscle glycogen, meaning that during the cardio you will be burning mostly fat. I’m trying to lose body fat and replace it with muscle. Should i do my cardio on the same day as weights or dedicate separate days to cardio?</p>
