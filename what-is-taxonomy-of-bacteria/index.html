Structure and classification of bacteria YouTube From youtube.com
The taxonomy of bacteria norberto j. Bacterial taxonomy is concerned with the naming of bacterial organisms and with organizing these names according to various criteria. The use of the single 16s rrna gene sequence to generate evolutionary phylogenetic trees improved the analysis of the relationships among newly obtained strains and those already described, allowing a faster and more accurate classification than. Organisms having similarities with respect to the criteria used are in the same group, and are separated from the other groups of microorganisms that have different characteristics.
