Types and health benefits of anaerobic exercise are exposed From vkool.com
The anaerobic energy system is vital for athletes, especially in sports requiring short energy and power bursts. Researchers studied the effects of 4 weeks of sprint interval training on aerobic and anaerobic performance in preseason iranian wrestlers. Generally, these activities are of short length with high intensity. Faster race times aren’t the only benefit of anaerobic training.
