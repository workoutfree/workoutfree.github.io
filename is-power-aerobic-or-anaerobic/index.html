As an intermediate pathway between the phosphagen and aerobic system, anaerobic glycolysis can produce atp quite rapidly for use during activities requiring large bursts of energy over somewhat longer periods of time (30 seconds to three minutes max, or during endurance activities prior to steady state being achieved).

<p>Before plants and animals can use this energy,. There are three primary dividing lines between the energy systemsâtime, fuel source, and oxygen. The two systems, anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis, occur at different intervals during exercise and draw upon different energy expenditures depending on the type of power that is being exerted. Aerobic power is a much better indicator of cardiovascular fitness and development in the weight bearing endurance sports such as cross country running and nordic skiing. Pin on Fitness.</p>
