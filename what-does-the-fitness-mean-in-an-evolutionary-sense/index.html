<p>Fitness is not the fastest or lifts the most weight. Evolutionary fitness is measured by the conribution to the gene pool into the next generation. Natural selection quantified by a measure called darwinian fitness or relative fitness. Individuals with genotypes favorable for current conditions are more likely to survive and reproduce.

<p>It is possible to have three types of ecological fitness: What events can lead to offspring having a unique arrangement of their parents’ genes? Evolution is natural selection, which means selecting an organism based on its fitness when a mutation helps an adaptation organism. What does “fitness” mean when speaking in terms of evolution? does your exercise effect your fitness?.</p>

<p>Officially, fitness is defined as the average number of children that organisms with a certain genotype or phenotype leave behind in comparison to the number of offspring left behind by other organisms in the community. Natural selection quantified by a measure called darwinian fitness or relative fitness. Those individuals that best fit the environment are said to have increased fitness. In evolutionary terms, “fitness” refers to an organism’s ability to reproduce successfully or to have the potential to reproduce successfully — in other words, its ability to contribute to the gene pool of its species.

<p>Evolutionary fitness is measured by the conribution to the gene pool into the next generation. Fitness is the ability of an organism to reproduce and pass on it's genetic information. Evolutionary biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to other genotypes. (10 days ago) evolutionary fitness is how well individuals in that population match the environmental conditions the population faces.
