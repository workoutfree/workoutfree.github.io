<p>Most people are better off going to another gym. Planet fitness is a gym that doesn’t want their paying members to be fit. When it comes to weights. It lacks basic pieces of strength equipment and has strict rules about lifting weights. Gym in Stratham, NH 20 Portsmouth Ave Fitness.</p>

<p>They want their members to continue to pay them money for as long as possible. When i first started going to the gym, i was overwhelmed of all of the weights and the people. Gold’s caters more heavily toward the weightlifting crowd with an excellent array of free weights and machinery, and an environment that encourages lifting heavy. It's super clean and neat.

<p>Man at the end of the day just go to pf if it's what you want to do. Unless you’re a beginner, a planet fitness membership isn’t worth it. It’s especially not a good look for planet fitness through the lifting communities’ eyes. In fact, most gyms in the franchise don’t have olympic benches or squat racks.

<p>Unless you’re a beginner, a planet fitness membership isn’t worth it. Smith machines make sure you don’t drop a barbell on your foot, face, or other important body part. The college gym always has all the bars loaded up and plates and dumbbells lying all over. Any gym that provides candy at the front desk, has pizza parties, and supplies bagels, does not have fitness and your best interest at heart. Gym in Rocky Point, NY 295 Route 25A Fitness.</p>

<p>In fact, most gyms in the franchise don’t have olympic benches or squat racks. I'd heard things about planet fitness gyms that i found hard to believe. Planet fitness is a better choice if you travel a lot within the us, but world gym is a better option if you travel internationally frequently. Many planet fitness members do want to make progress of course, but the gym's own rules and operating guidelines seem to dissuade this. Gym in Edison, NJ 561 US Hwy 1 Fitness.</p>

<p>One of my friends currently has a gym membership at planet fitness and he's telling me how it's a really good gym and how they have free trainers with the black subscription (the $20/mo one or so). The biggest difference between gold’s gym and planet fitness is definitely the equipment selection and culture. Whatever gets people off the couch and in motion is a great thing for me. 3.) creates an atmosphere for people to get active. Gym in Glenville, NY 300 Saratoga Rd Fitness.</p>

<p>That means location is probably the most important factor. It’s especially not a good look for planet fitness through the lifting communities’ eyes.
