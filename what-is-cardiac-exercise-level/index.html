“your recovery heart rate is the decrease in heart rate one minute after exercise ceases. An exercise stress test is designed to find out if one or more of the coronary arteries feeding the heart contain fatty deposits (plaques) that block a blood vessel 70% or more. Before starting a cardio workout routine, take stock of your fitness level, and be realistic about what an exercise program would be like for you. Once you know your maximum heart rate, you can calculate your desired target heart rate zone — the level at which your heart is being exercised and conditioned but not overworked.
