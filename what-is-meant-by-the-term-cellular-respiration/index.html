What Is The Definition Of Cellular Respiration In Biology SHOTWERK From shotwerk.blogspot.com
Cells produce energy in the form of atp through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration synonyms, cellular respiration pronunciation, cellular respiration translation, english dictionary definition of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a metabolic process consisting of a series of steps to convert chemical energy (sugar) into a usable form of energy (atp) in the cell. Breathing refers to a biological process of exhaling and inhaling the gases between the environment and cells and also involves several respiratory structures like lungs, nose, and windpipe.
