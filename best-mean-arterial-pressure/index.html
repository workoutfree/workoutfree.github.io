Mean arterial pressure ( top ) and BQ123induced changes in mean From researchgate.net
To calculate a mean arterial pressure, double the diastolic blood pressure and add the sum to the systolic blood pressure. To calculate your map, two values are required. Mean arterial pressure (map) measures the flow, resistance, and pressure in your arteries during one heartbeat. Is mean arterial pressure the best parameter in ischemic stroke?

<p>Mean arterial pressure is an indication of global perfusion pressure necessary for organ perfusion and oxygen delivery. Arterial blood pressure consists of several distinct components—systolic and diastolic pressures, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure (fig. Mean cpp during cpr was calculated by the difference between the aortic pressure and the right atrial pressure during the relaxation phase of cpr (“diastolic period”). Mean arterial pressure (map) is the product of cardiac output (co) and total peripheral vascular resistance (tpr).</p>

<p>Mean arterial blood pressure results from a product of co (cardiac output) and total svr (systemic vascular resistance) 4, hence map is expected to correlate with co. When the mean arterial pressure goes too low it means there is less blood getting to the vital organs and could cause you to go into shock. Changes in either of these parameters also influence map.
