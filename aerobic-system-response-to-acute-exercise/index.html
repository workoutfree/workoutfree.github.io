Atp intensity 'the currency of the body' would you rather? As a result the predominant energy system and fuel source used changes throughout the exercise in order to maintain the required level of performance. To that end, we propose an acute exercise study that will investigate the acute effects of aerobic exercise with incremental degrees.
