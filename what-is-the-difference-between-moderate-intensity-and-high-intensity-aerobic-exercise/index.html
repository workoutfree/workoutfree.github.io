<p>Moderate activities include brisk walking, biking, raking leaves, swimming, dancing or water aerobics. Here’s how the canadian researchers described the difference between moderate and vigorous physical activity: This is a subtle distinction, but it's an important one. This means your body breaks down stored glucose in the muscles and organs without using oxygen. The Science of P90X Heart Rate Zones and Intensity — Tyler Robbins.</p>
