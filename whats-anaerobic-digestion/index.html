The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to manage waste or to produce fuels. Organic matter, such as food waste or animal manure, is consumed by bacteria as a food source, which results in the bacteria producing biogas. So, methane or biogas is the name of the gas. The total annual potential production of this renewable energy source is estimated at around 200 billions m 3 (appels et al., 2008).

<p>Anaerobic digestion is a sequence of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. Not all materials break down at the same speed, and. Since there is a continuous production of the waste materials used for the digestion process, anaerobic digestion can ensure a steady source of electricity generation. Anaerobic digestion (ad) is the most extensively employed sludge stabilisation process. Anaerobic Digestion Diagram Geoline Lining Systems Stormwater.</p>

<p>Anaerobic digestion is a natural biological process where microorganisms, or bacteria, break down biodegradable organic matter like sewage sludge, food scraps, and manure. Anaerobic digestion is a sequence of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. Organic matter, such as food waste or animal manure, is consumed by bacteria as a food source, which results in the bacteria producing biogas.
