<p>Depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken, the whole procedure will take 15 to 90 minutes. The mri results are actually back within an hour or two, if it is an emergency. Depends on the hospital, part (s) of the body being scanned, how urgent the scan was requested, how the results were communicated, how busy the radiologists were, whether any abnormalities were identified, how long it takes for the secretaries to type up the letter, whether you had it as an inpatient or outpatient etc. If you doctor said it was urgent and the receptionist said it could take up to 4 weeks, i would find another doctor. .</p>

<p>If you doctor said it was urgent and the receptionist said it could take up to 4 weeks, i would find another doctor. For one that is suppose to be urgent it should be less than a week. On average i would say, i have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for a routine mri. In this case, the result will be reviewed as quickly as possible and a radiologist or emergency medicine doctor will attend to you. .</p>

<p>Cancer wasn't mentioned by the doc as a possibility (nor was a benign tumour) but she did suggest epilepsy. On average i would say, i have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for a routine mri. Well, it depends on the nature of the test (emergency or routine), time of day, day of the week and other factors. But usually, the result of an mri scan comes within 24 hours and it is also interpreted within 24 hours by a specialized radiologist and similarly,if the result of an mri scan comes within 24. .</p>

<p>I had an mri of my head and neck and it took about three weeks to get the results in a letter (nothing to worry about in the end).

<p>Depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken, the whole procedure will take 15 to 90 minutes. The first i had to drink over a litre of water and this one was a complete fasting for 4 hours before the scan and an intravenous contrast dye.

On average i would say, i have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for a routine mri. .</p>
<h3 id="thank-you-for-posting-on-this-forum-it">Thank You For Posting On This Forum, It.</h3><p>The first i had to drink over a litre of water and this one was a complete fasting for 4 hours before the scan and an intravenous contrast dye. The upshot is that they can't usually be 100% certain of a diagnosis using mri, but they might get quite a good idea about the nature of what's in there, and it will help them decide if it's worth taking out so that they can check what it is properly. You may be asked to hold your breath during short scans. Yeap the images are viewed within 24 to 48 hours and the results are typed and ready to go within another 10 to 12 why it takes so long i.</p>

Ultimately, the answer to this question is that it depends. Waiting two weeks in light of the urgent cancer referral time limit seems reasonable. That was when i has a suspected aneurysm.</p>
