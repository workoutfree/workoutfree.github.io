<p>When we exercise, we need more fuel to get to our muscles so your heart beats faster to get more of that fuel to your muscles to make energy. Aerobic exercise has produced a greater oxygen delivery through the red blood cells within your body. This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. Exercise makes your heart stronger to pump more blood with less effort.</p>

<p>In a resting heart, the cardiac output is about 5 liters a minute (0.07 l x 70 beats/min = 4.9 l/min). This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. Also, the sympathetic nerve stimulation to the veins causes them to constrict. Exercise decreases the blood’s content of cholesterol and triglycerides. Image Gallery heart and lung circulation.</p>
