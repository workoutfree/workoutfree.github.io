Blood under low pressure flows into left and right atria from pulmonary veins and vena cava. The different phases of the cardiac cycle involve: Systole and diastole affect each other in an intimate manner to accomplish this goal. These pressure changes originate as conductive electrochemical changes within the myocardium that result in the concentric contraction of.

<p>The cardiac cycle is the sequence of electrical and mechanical events that are repeated with each heartbeat. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. The cardiac cycle is the series of contractions in the heart that pressurize different chambers, causing blood to flood in one direction. âthe cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next.

The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac cycle ().the period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole.the period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole.both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole, and it is. Duration of cardiac cycle depends on the heart rate per minute. Function of the Heart Although the heartâs right and left sides are.</p>

<p>One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive. The filling of the ventricle (diastole) is followed by ventricular contraction (systole) to provide an adequate cardiac output during both rest and exercise to meet the body's metabolic demands. Pressure from the atria then forces the atrioventricular valves open and blood flows into the ventricles. Myocardiocytes are unique cells found in the heart that are able to independently.

<p>There is an inverse relationship between the duration of cardiac cycle and heart rate. The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle. Hence when the heart rate is increased to 120 beats per minute, the cardiac cycle duration will be about. Systole and diastole affect each other in an intimate manner to accomplish this goal.
