Highintensity, lowimpact, and loads of fun—trampoline fitness is From pinterest.com

Anything that has you stationary and lifting weight — like squats , deadlifts or bench presses — is going to be easier on your joints, but it can be pretty intense at the same time. As boxall explains, “there are plenty of exercises that can bring the heart rate up without involving a high impact element.” high intensity, low impact interval training is basically hiit without the jumping. Balancing liss and hiit workouts allows you to build muscle and stamina while enhancing your cardiovascular health.
