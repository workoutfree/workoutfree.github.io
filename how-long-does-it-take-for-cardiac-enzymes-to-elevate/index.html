Anthony s fauci et al.; Elevations of cardiac enzyme levels should be interpreted in the context of clinical and ecg findings [ 1]. Healthcare providers use enzyme marker tests (blood tests) to measure. Cardiac troponins t and i are the preferred markers for myocardial injury as they have the highest sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [ 1].
