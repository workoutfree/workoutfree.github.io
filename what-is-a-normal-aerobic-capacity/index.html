It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. In addition to measuring your fitness level, results will help you establish optimal heart rate (hr) zones for exercise, to scientifically guide your training, and indicate your risk for cardiovascular disease. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. Vo2 max per kg body mass in boys had a mean value of 59 ml.

The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. The individual’s aerobic capacity defines the size of the engine in a human being, much as in an automobile. The Online Scum June 2015.</p>

<p>In addition to measuring your fitness level, results will help you establish optimal heart rate (hr) zones for exercise, to scientifically guide your training, and indicate your risk for cardiovascular disease. Sports competition stands for a typical test of athlete’s physical capacity. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).

<p>Aerobic capacity is a way to measure how efficiently the above scenario takes place. It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. It is believed that aerobic capacity is directly proportional to cardiorespiratory fitness based on heart rate factors often influenced by body size, climate, gender. It is a popular indicator of physical efficiency (especially aerobic efficiency). Momentum Training Energy System Training Part 3 Anaerobic Athlete.</p>
