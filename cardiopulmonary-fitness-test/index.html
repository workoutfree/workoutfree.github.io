<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is a maximal exercise test with concomitant gas exchange analysis that provides an integrative and comprehensive assessment of physiologic responses to exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. The co 2 analyzer should read a room air fraction of 0.03±0.02% and should not change when the 100% n 2 or 16% o 2 fractions are sampled from the calibration tanks. While cardio exercise is great for burning calories and losing weight, it also improves your cardiovascular fitness.
