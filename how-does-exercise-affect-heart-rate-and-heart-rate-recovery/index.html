As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more. As the heart rate is a significant indicator of myocardial oxygen demand, individuals with a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute (bpm) were found in several studies to have a threefold increased mortality risk compared to those with a rate lower than.
