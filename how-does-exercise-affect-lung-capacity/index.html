<p>Minute ventilation is the volume of air you breathe in a minute. This affects the size of the chest cavity, which in turn reduces lung capacity. How does exercise affect breathing? Does total lung capacity change during exercise? How does sex affect airway disorders such as asthma and chronic.</p>

<p>Minute ventilation increases during exercise because both tidal volume and breathing rate increase. This exchange occurs at the alveolar membrane, between the alveoli and capillaries in the lungs. Vital capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be breathed into or out of the lungs in one breath. Minute ventilation is measured in. How does diet affect the respiratory system.</p>
