We can define muscular endurance as the ability of a muscle, or a group of muscles, to repeatedly exert a force (contract) for an extended period.
Muscular Endurance vs. Muscular Strength What&#39;s the Difference? Shape From shape.com
A person&#39;s ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many physiological parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption. The definition of cardiovascular endurance simply put is the body’s ability to continue exertion while getting energy from the aerobic system used to supply the body with energy. Essentially, it is the heart and lungs delivering energy to a body in motion without undue fatigue, according to the department of health and human services. Endurance is the ability of muscle to sustain forces repeatedly or to.
