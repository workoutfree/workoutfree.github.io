<meta name="description" content="20 Min Definition Of Aerobic Respiration In Biology For Weight Loss, Aerobic respiration combines oxygen with glucose to generate carbon dioxide, water, and cellular energy in the form of atp. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy.
aerobic respiration Google Search Cellular respiration Pinterest From pinterest.com
Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration that does not require oxygen and can occur in animals, plants and other microorganisms. All organisms require energy to carry out various activities.
