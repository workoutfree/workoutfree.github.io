So, anaerobic exercises are the exercises that result in resisting in oxygen supply. The difference is made up by anaerobic metabolism, of which the principal product is lactic acid (see fig. Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. Anaerobic creatures or processes do not need oxygen in order to function or survive.
