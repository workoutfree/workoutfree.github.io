<p>Once we know this data we can work on aerobic power, a necessary step to improve fpt. Zone 5 is safe for all, but it may be difficult to achieve when running on flat terrain. Aerobic power is a much better indicator of cardiovascular fitness and development in the weight bearing endurance sports such as cross country running and nordic skiing. With good planning and a series of workouts aimed at improving our maximal aerobic power, we will be more consistent in these higher power ranges and then we can work.

The highest ever recorded vo2 max is 94 ml/kg/min in men and 77 ml/kg/min in women. It is also associated with the performance of vigorous bouts of exercise in competitive cardiorepiratory events. It is a power output that corresponds to the maximal oxygen consumption intensity.</p>
<h3 id="vo2-at-at-in-trained-subjects-was-greater-than-untrained-subjects-in-both-sexes">Vo2 At At In Trained Subjects Was Greater Than Untrained Subjects In Both Sexes.</h3><p>This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). In other words, it is the lowest speed at which maximum oxygen uptake (v0 2 max) occurrs (2, 3). More than 115% of maximal aerobic power. However, when comparing elite athletes, the gap tends to close to about 10% (3).</p>

This relates directly to the rate that the heart can. This speed is used to help set running paces in training programs. Maximal aerobic power is a useful, meaningful and motivational physiological measurement fitness professionals and personal trainers utilize to track progress with their clients.</p>
