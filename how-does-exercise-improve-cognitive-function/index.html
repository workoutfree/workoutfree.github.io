Does aerobic exercise improve cognitive function? Science Fair From pinterest.com
Aerobic exercise did not improve cognitive function in processing speed, language, attention, or episodic memory for participants of any age. The benefits of exercise come directly from its ability to reduce insulin resistance, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the release of growth factors—chemicals in the brain that affect the health of brain cells, the growth of new blood vessels. However, most studies performed on older subjects with dementia showed no effect of exercise on cognition. As the brain ages, it becomes more important for a person to exercise for their cognitive health.
